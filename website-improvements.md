# Arc Forge Website - Messaging Improvements

**Created**: 2025-11-25
**Purpose**: Customer-focused copy that speaks to real pain points

---

## Current Problems with Website

### Issue 1: Tech jargon alienates target audience
**Current**: "Open source self-hosted infrastructure. Deploy it yourself or get help."
**Problem**: Small business owners don't know what "self-hosted" or "infrastructure" means
**They think**: "This sounds complicated and technical - not for me"

### Issue 2: Feature lists without context
**Current**: Lists "Nextcloud, Vaultwarden, n8n" with no explanation of why you need them
**Problem**: Customers don't know what these tools are or what problems they solve
**They think**: "What is n8n? Do I need it? Is this overkill?"

### Issue 3: Generic value proposition
**Current**: "Control your costs" is abstract
**Problem**: Doesn't paint the picture of the actual frustration
**They think**: "Yeah, everyone says that"

### Issue 4: Missing emotional triggers
**Current**: Focuses on technical benefits (control, ownership)
**Problem**: Doesn't address the real pain points that drive buying decisions
**Missing**: Anger at vendor price increases, fear of vendor lock-in, frustration with complexity

## Improved Messaging Framework

### New Hero Section

**Option A - Pain-first (Direct)**
```
# Stop Getting Gouged By Subscription Services

You're paying $500+ per month for business software that keeps raising prices.
You don't control your data. You're locked in.

There's a better way: Own your business technology instead of renting it.

We set up the same tools (file storage, password management, workflow automation)
on YOUR server. You pay $75/month for hosting instead of $500/month to vendors.

Fixed cost. No surprise price increases. You control everything.

```

**Option B - Aspirational (Future-state)**
```
# Your Business Technology Should Work For You - Not Against You

Imagine: All your files, passwords, and workflows in one place.
Your team can access everything from office or field.
It works offline. It never raises prices on you.
You own it completely.

That's what we build. Not complicated. Not expensive. Just yours.

Most small businesses save $6,000+ per year compared to SaaS.
Setup takes 1 week. No ongoing vendor payments to us.

[Calculate Your Savings] [See How It Works]
```

**Option C - Problem-solution (Balanced)**
```
# Tired of SaaS Vendors Controlling Your Costs?

You started with one tool at $10/month. Now you're paying $500/month across
5 different services that don't talk to each other.

Every quarter: Another price increase. Another feature locked behind "Enterprise" tier.
Your data scattered everywhere. No integration. No control.

We help small businesses take back control:
→ One integrated platform on YOUR server
→ Fixed $75/month hosting cost (no per-user fees)
→ All your files, passwords, automation in one place
→ Works offline. You own it. No vendor lock-in.

Average business saves $6,180/year compared to Google Workspace + Dropbox + LastPass.

## New Comparison Section

### Before/After Customer Language

**Replace technical comparison with customer pain points:**

| Your Current Problem | With Your Own Platform |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| **"Another price increase email"** - Vendors raise prices whenever they want | **Fixed hosting cost** - $75/month, period. No surprises. |
| **"Locked into a 1-year contract"** - Can't switch even when prices increase | **Cancel anytime** - VPS providers are month-to-month. Switch whenever. |
| **"Data scattered across 5 tools"** - Files in Dropbox, passwords in LastPass, automation in Zapier | **Everything integrated** - One login, all your tools work together |
| **"Doesn't work without internet"** - Field workers can't access files on job sites | **Offline-capable** - Files sync, apps work without connection |
| **"Paying for 50 user licenses"** - But only 12 people use it | **No per-user fees** - Flat $75/month hosting regardless of team size |

---

## New FAQ Section (Customer Language)

**Replace technical FAQs with real objections:**

### "I'm not technical. Will this be complicated?"

No. You use it exactly like Google Drive or Dropbox - web browser, mobile app, or desktop sync.
We handle all the technical setup. You get user-friendly interfaces and clear documentation.

Your team won't know the difference (except it's faster and costs less).

---

### "What if something breaks and you're not around?"

1. **It's designed to be stable** - These are the same open-source tools running on thousands of business servers worldwide
2. **You have documentation** - Clear troubleshooting guides for common issues
3. **You're not locked in** - Any IT person can manage it (it's standard Docker containers)
4. **Optional support available** - $150/month monitoring and priority help if you want it

We're not trying to create dependency. We're giving you ownership.

---

### "My IT guy told me self-hosting is risky and I should stay on Google"

Your IT guy probably wants to keep billing you hourly to manage Google Workspace.

Self-hosting isn't riskier IF it's set up correctly:
- Automatic backups (tested weekly)
- Automatic security updates
- SSL certificates (same as any website)
- Professional monitoring (optional)

Google had a 4-hour Gmail outage in 2020. YouTube went down for 2 hours in 2021.
Big cloud providers have outages too - at least with your own server, YOU control when updates happen.

---

### "What's the catch? Why isn't everyone doing this?"

No catch. But it's not for everyone:

**Good fit:**
- 5-50 person teams
- Stable business (not hiring 10 people next month)
- Want predictable costs
- Value data privacy and control

**Not a good fit:**
- Need enterprise compliance (SOC2, HIPAA - stick with vendors)
- Hiring rapidly (per-user SaaS scales easier short-term)
- Zero technical capability in-house (need someone who can reset passwords)

Most small businesses are a great fit. They just don't know this option exists.

---

### "Why should I trust you instead of Google/Microsoft?"

You shouldn't trust us either - that's the point.

With Google, you're locked in. If they raise prices or shut down a service, you're stuck.

With us, you get:
1. **Open source software** - Not proprietary. Any developer can maintain it.
2. **Standard infrastructure** - Docker containers on Linux. Any IT person can manage it.
3. **Full documentation** - You're not dependent on us.
4. **Easy migration** - If you want to leave, export your data and go.

We're not asking for trust. We're giving you independence.

## Social Proof Section (Add New)

**Missing from current website - add customer language examples:**

### "We were paying $600/month to multiple vendors..."

"I was paying $600/month across Google Workspace, Dropbox Business, LastPass,
and Zapier. Every quarter there was another price increase.

Arc Forge set us up with the same functionality on our own server for $75/month
hosting. We own it completely.

ROI: 12 months. After that, we're saving $525/month. Every month."

— Sarah T., Accounting Firm Owner, Adelaide

---

### "Our field workers couldn't access files without internet..."

"My landscaping crews are on job sites without internet half the day. They
couldn't quote jobs on-site because all our files were in Dropbox.

Now everything syncs to their tablets. They can pull up past quotes, generate
new ones, and sync when they get back to WiFi. We went from 2-day quote turnaround
to 20 minutes on-site."

— Mike R., Embark Excavation & Landscaping

## Implementation Priority

### Quick wins (1-2 hours):
1. **Hero section rewrite** - Use Option C (balanced approach)
2. **Service names** - Replace Essential/Professional/Premium with outcome names
3. **FAQ rewrite** - Use customer objection language

### Medium effort (2-4 hours):
4. **Comparison table** - Replace technical features with customer pain points
5. **Add social proof section** - 2-3 customer testimonials (even if hypothetical/permission-pending)
6. **CTA button text** - Replace all generic CTAs with outcome-focused language

### Polish (1 hour):
7. **Remove technical jargon** - Replace "infrastructure", "self-hosted", "VPS" with plain language
8. **Add cost calculator** - Simple form: "How many users? Current monthly spend?" → Shows savings
9. **Add trust signals** - "No lock-in guarantee", "Open source code", "14-day money-back"

---

## Measurement Criteria

**How to know if improved messaging is working:**

1. **Time on site increases** - People stay longer reading (currently bouncing on jargon)
2. **Contact form completion increases** - Lower barrier to entry
3. **Better qualified leads** - People understand what you do before contacting
4. **Fewer "Is this technical?" questions** - Clearer positioning upfront

---

**Next Step**: Choose which hero section option (A, B, or C) and implement quick wins first.
